# Taylor Owen Personal Website

## Project Overview

Personal academic website for Taylor Owen, built with Next.js 15 (App Router) and statically exported. Hosted on Cloudflare Workers (static assets), served at https://www.taylorowen.com (apex `taylorowen.com` 301-redirects to `www`). The site showcases writing, podcasts, video, blog posts, and contact information.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router (`output: 'export'` for static site generation)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode, `@/*` path alias maps to `./src/*`)
- **Styling:** Inline styles + CSS custom properties in `globals.css` (gold theme). Tailwind CSS v4 is installed but used minimally.
- **Blog:** Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, parsed by `gray-matter` and rendered with `remark` + `remark-html`
- **React:** v19

## Key Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start dev server (port 3000)
- `npm run build` — Static export build
- `npm start` — Start production server
- `npm run lint` — Run Next.js linting

## Hosting & Deployment

- **Cloudflare Workers (static assets):** Project name `taylorowen`. Build output (`out/`) is uploaded as static assets — no SSR/Worker code.
- **Auto-deploy:** Push to `main` triggers Cloudflare to run `npm run build`, then deploy via `npx wrangler deploy`. Build settings live in the Cloudflare dashboard; static-asset config lives in `wrangler.jsonc` at the repo root.
- **DNS:** `taylorowen.com` zone is managed by Cloudflare. Domain is still registered at GoDaddy (nameservers point to Cloudflare).
- **Apex → www redirect:** Single Redirect rule in Cloudflare: hostname `taylorowen.com` → `https://www.taylorowen.com$path`, 301.

## Architecture Notes

- **Static Export:** `next.config.ts` sets `output: 'export'` and `images.unoptimized: true`. Outputs to `out/`, which Cloudflare serves directly.
- **Inline Styles + CSS Classes:** Most styling is inline. CSS classes are added to elements that need mobile responsive overrides (since media queries can't override inline styles). These classes use `!important` in `@media (max-width: 768px)` rules in `globals.css`.
- **Theme:** Gold theme with CSS custom properties (`--color-accent: #b08d57`, `--color-text: #1a1a1a`, etc.) defined in `:root`.
- **Fonts:** Headings use `Times New Roman` / Georgia serif stack. Body uses system sans-serif.
- **Header:** Sticky, with underline hover animation on nav links. Mobile breakpoint at 768px hides desktop nav/social icons and shows a hamburger menu with full-screen overlay.
- **Writing Page:** Uses `useState` to toggle between category sections (Books, Essays, Opinion, Journal Articles, Reports, Book Chapters) via filter chip buttons.
- **Blog Posts:** Stored as `.md` files in `content/blog/`. Frontmatter requires `title`, `date`, and `excerpt` fields. Posts are sorted by date descending.

## Mobile Responsive Classes

These CSS classes exist solely for mobile media query overrides:
- `.hero-section`, `.post-row`, `.post-date` — Homepage
- `.about-grid`, `.about-photo` — About page
- `.podcast-grid` — Podcasts page
- `.video-grid` — Video page
- `.blog-date-col`, `.blog-divider`, `.blog-content-col`, `.blog-date-mobile` — Blog page
- `.contact-name-grid` — Contact page
- `.footer-inner` — Footer
- `.desktop-nav`, `.desktop-social`, `.hamburger` — Header

## Adding a Blog Post

Create a new `.md` file in `content/blog/` with this format:

```markdown
---
title: "Post Title Here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
excerpt: "A brief summary of the post."
---

Post body content in Markdown...
```

The post will automatically appear on the homepage (if among the 5 most recent) and on the blog listing page.
