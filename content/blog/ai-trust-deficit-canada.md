There's a growing trust deficit around AI in Canada.

A new survey from the Centre for Media, Technology, and Democracy at McGill shows that most Canadians don't trust AI — and they especially don't trust the companies building it.

This raises a fundamental question for policymakers: how do you govern a technology that the public has already lost faith in?
