excerpt: "Instead of a permanent ban on kids using social media, Helen Hayes and I make the case for a temporary moratorium tied to the establishment of a digital safety regulator."

Last week I argued that banning kids from social media is the wrong approach. I still think a permanent ban is a flawed instrument. But if the public support and political momentum for age restrictions is real -- and it clearly is -- then the question becomes: how could we design limits that actually fix the problem rather than just manage the symptom?

In a new piece for The Globe and Mail, Helen Hayes and I make the case for a temporary moratorium on social media access for children, tied directly to the establishment of a digital safety regulator. Not a permanent ban, but a bridge: a time-limited measure to buy space for real structural reform.
