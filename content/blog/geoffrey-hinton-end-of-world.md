When Geoffrey Hinton quit Google to warn the world about AI, a lot of people dismissed him. A year and a half later, I think his concerns have only become more relevant.

In our conversation on Machines Like Us, Hinton laid out his case for why superintelligent AI could pose an existential risk — and why he thinks we're not taking it seriously enough.

Whether you agree with his most dire predictions or not, there's something undeniably important about one of the founders of deep learning saying we need to slow down and think carefully about what we're building.
