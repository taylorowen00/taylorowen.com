excerpt: "Ava Smithing's new documentary podcast about what happens when you hand kids the most powerful technology in history — and then walk away."

Over the past couple of years I have gotten the chance to know and collaborate with Ava Smithing. Aside from being an incredible and inspiring person, and a leader in the youth digital rights movement, Ava is one of the most impressive policy thinkers, advocates, and communicators I have ever worked with.

We have been lucky enough to have her as a Fellow at the Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy, where she has been working with our youth fellows to advance Canadian policy around child and youth online safety. And she has been working with our team at Paradigms and the Toronto Star to make a documentary podcast.

It just launched. And it's amazing.

*Left to Their Own Devices* asks a question that should concern all of us: what happens when you hand kids the most powerful technology in history, and then walk away?

I could not recommend it enough. You can listen on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3Yr9NTZYu5S1xUIihwd6UK), and at the Toronto Star.
