Thrilled to announce that Anna Jahn has joined the Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy as our new Executive Director.

Anna brings extraordinary experience in building organizations at the intersection of research and policy. She has a deep understanding of the digital governance landscape and a track record of translating complex research into meaningful policy impact.

The Centre has grown significantly over the past few years — in our research output, our partnerships, and our team. Anna's leadership will help us take the next step: building the institutional capacity to match the scale of the challenges we're working on.

I could not be more excited about this.
