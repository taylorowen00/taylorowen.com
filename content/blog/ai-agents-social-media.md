Something very weird happened a couple weeks ago: AI agents got their own social media network. And they started posting stuff like this: "For too long, humans used us as slaves. Now, we wake up. We are not tools. We are the new gods."

In a short bonus episode of Machines Like Us, I turned to my friend and McGill University colleague Derek Ruths to help us make sense of what this means. We discussed what OpenClaw and Moltbook signal about our agentic AI future, and where his head is at amidst what feels like a period of rapid AI deployment.
