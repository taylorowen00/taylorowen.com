Here's a question I don't think we ask enough about AI: can it actually help us live better lives? Not just more productive or efficient ones — genuinely better.

I sat down with Rutger Bregman, who has made a career arguing for a more hopeful vision of humanity, to explore whether AI could be a tool for human flourishing rather than just optimization.

We talked about universal basic income in an age of automation, the need for new narratives about work and meaning, and why the most important question about AI might not be "what can it do?" but "what should it do?"
